d8d77c61-b318-4e1c-90ab-408b7a2dff87	In the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you 'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters -- damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide .

84b14083-0f64-40dd-b4df-1b1eff3860f6	The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
e7382662-d7c7-4208-b28b-2e07787c2621	Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .

c4f1e722-4fa2-4503-944d-8cd7468d9287	All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .
394f3012-4727-4587-bd1f-a4e24873d574	Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .

9b009ac3-cd2d-48a8-a750-fbd4da2c6f23	It has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out .
9b916683-ce15-4e18-b0ec-05336106bf9f	Crummy .

7b954c29-1066-4b31-8232-9b76c1b98c20	Director Alfonso Cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of French New Wave films .

a5ca78f4-1d30-45be-a88d-503ef2a0561d	While Undercover Brother is definitely one for the masses , it 's also full of sharp , smart satire .
12e1ecd0-913e-40e2-9ee2-5012b41c9086	This version does justice both to Stevenson and to the sci-fi genre .
f75ab935-5f83-43ef-9875-87077c159370	At 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .
